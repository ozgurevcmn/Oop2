# Object-Oriented Programming Examples in C#

This repository contains a collection of examples demonstrating various concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) using C#.

## Contents

1. **Polymorphism**
    - Example 1: Method Overloading (`Polymorphism.cs`)
    - Example 2: Method Overriding (`Polymorphism2.cs`)

2. **Inheritance**
    - Example 1: Animal Hierarchy (`Inheritance.cs`, `Dog.cs`, `Cat.cs`)
    - Example 2: Shape Hierarchy (`Circle.cs`)
    - Example 3: Family Tree (`Parent.cs`, `Child.cs`)

3. **Generic Type**
    - Example: `Box<T>` class for storing items of various types (`Box.cs`)

4. **Encapsulation**
    - Example: `BankAccount` class demonstrating encapsulation of account details and operations (`BankAccount.cs`)

## Usage
